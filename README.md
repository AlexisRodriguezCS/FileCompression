## About The Project

This is a C++ program that performs file compression and decompression using the Hoffman Coding technique. The program utilizes a priority queue implemented with a custom binary search tree and a hashmap. The nodes within the binary search tree are organized based on their priority, and nodes with the same priority are allowed and connected as a linked list.

The program functions as a file/string compression algorithm and allows for the compression and decompression of files using the Huffman algorithm. It makes use of binary trees and priority queues to achieve its functionality.

In summary, this C++ program provides an implementation of the Huffman Coding technique for file compression and decompression. It uses a custom priority queue implemented as a binary search tree and hashmap.h file, with nodes organized by priority and linked as necessary. This program is a useful tool for anyone looking to compress and decompress files or strings in their work or personal projects.

Here's an online demo of the project hosted on [repl.it](https://replit.com/@Alexisrz/FileCompression) for you to try out.
